Rather just facetank most with drain life, might give it a try now\ni would love to do it, sadly i have no way to get aggro on myself, since the npc is doing 350k dps, so pet is the only way snce it got a taunt. when he dies mobs go straight on the npc. #4 22/03/2015 Zephi Profile Zephi 100 Human Warlock BIRD PLEASE 17635 Alright im back(successfully)\nTook me 4 tries, but the idea was right;\nYou cant tank at all, your damage is (almost) useless, had a few times where I finished some npcs off, but was mostly focusing on controlling / resummoning or kiting\nYour pet however, has a strong taunt, it gets aggro fast, resummon it when its about to die, never do it instantly, as its almost guranteed to die on the last 2 waves\nFear, fear, fear, I fear everything all the time, my fear in crit-mastery gear(my cm gear) is faster than the pyroblast cast time, so I literally spam that every single global on casters / big adds so they cant kill my pet / the npc.\nWith catalysm / all cds I could manage to aggro the small ones for a little while and kite them with glyphed HoG/gateway/port\nGrim. serv. is imo mandatory, the silence on pyromancer wave 8 saved my !@#\nShadowfury is very strong, kite adds with your pet into the fire(it cant take damage from it) then stun em there.\nWent darksoul glyph since I only used it to attempt getting aggro, if theres 3 or 4 adds she only single target so you can just grab aggro of the others / fear them and try kite around\nUse infernal for stun, wave 1-5 was pretty easy, but it gets hectic when your pet dies wave 6-7 and your forced to instant resummon and watch it die again, I finished off with my pet dead just spamming fear on the pyromancer till the npc killed it\nIt might come down to fire RNG, I think its worth letting the npc cast the fire AoE, but I almost wiped because of it, as the fire stacks breaks my fear rather fast, and having a big add + pyromancer up is an issue without pet(and even with). Ideally pyromancers always get prio on fear, they simply do too much damage\nGl Edited by Zephi on 22/03/2015 22:33 GMT #5 22/03/2015 Nihlaa Profile Nihlaa 100 Undead Warlock I N T E N T 3745 We all got that achievement in RL already by playing warlock as dps @ WOD. #6 23/03/2015 -1 Veerloren Profile Veerloren 100 Undead Warlock Legio Excisio 22040 tried again yesterday, went worse than last time.\neither i wait a few weeks or im just not up to that :(\ngrats on your achiev, well done! #7 23/03/2015 Heretus Profile Heretus 100 Blood Elf Warlock Protoss 9590 22/03/2015 20:48 Posted by Veerloren anyone has done it as lock in WoD?\ni facerolled it in in MoP with dark apotheosis but its so much harder now,\ntried it the following day, bronze was a cakewalk but silver seems really hard. got to wave 7 on my best try, but then my void just went splat 2 times in a row. i guess interrupt is needed but i just dont have it with void out. tried both with GoSup and GoServ (so i can have an extra felly for interrupt) but void seems just so squishy especially with GoServ.\notherwise i was using my usual affli spec + cata to aoe small packs faster.\nanyone has done it? i really want this achiev done, 7th wave was pretty encouraging but then i couldnt reach it again, i guess i just stressed out.\nHave done it first try as affliction with tank pet out and i suppose i could help you with that:\nas above , have tank pet out and have it tank the mob with the highest damage , then either spread dots on every thing you see (use soulburn SoC then SoC spam on groups) or use fear on a high dmg mob (i used fear on those pyroblast casters till everything else was dead then focused them). If you find that tank pet takes too much damage , you can heal it while your dots damage the mobs.\nIt will help if you have improved demons and siphon life glyphs. If your pet dies do not panic, soul burn and insta summon it . I would not recommend soulburn haunt for this achi since you can use your shards for summoning and Soulburn SoC a lot. As for control i suppose both howl of terror and shadowburn could help out, i used howl to fear those flying mobs away , coupled with single target fear on caster mobs, remember there is no DR on mobs , you can perma fear them\nAs affli i actually found it kinda easy to do. Hope tips help Edited by Heretus on 27/03/2015 09:29 GMT #8 27/03/2015 +1 Veerloren Profile Veerloren 100 Undead Warlock Legio Excisio 22040 sorry for digging up my old topic, but decided to try it yesterday again, after quite many wipes i finally got it right today, like 5 min ago.\nty for tips, both Zephi and Heretus, they did help a lot.\nits perfectly possible, even if it can take time to get everything right, my biggest issue, after i found a solution to pet deaths, was killing the 7th wave in time tbh before the 8th comes out but in the end i managed to fix that as well.\nim a happy little affli lock now, i just wish i could queue as tank for hcs now hehe, but we cant have everything :) #9 27/04/2015 Veígar Profile Veígar 100 Gnome Warlock 8770 I made the tanking part. bronze and silver. back when Highmaul was the only raid in WOD.\nIt was demo, using Voidwalker to tank. using AoE stun and fearing alot..\nCC as much as possible.\nHave the talent to summon 1 more voidwalker at the last level. AND have your infernal to mass stun + tank too..\nSo basicly. you have 3 tanking pets out at the same time at last level. thats how i did it.. was hard, but i got it.\nIm pretty sure i got it on silver.. ( havent played my lock since BRF ) #10 04/05/2015 Veerloren Profile Veerloren 100 Undead Warlock Legio Excisio 22040 well done Veigar :)\npersonally i found howl of terror more useful than shadowfury, it practically saved my !@# on wave 8 on my succesful try :) #11 05/05/2015 \"You are doing it wrong\" achiev, anyone?

The other 2 lvl 100 talents are !@#$ for us anyway.

On ptr I crit around 50k incinerates with immo and procs and similar conflags on players with trinkets. About 180k+ Chaosbolts without fully optimized gear (no access to some mastery pieces).

I imagine if you play 3s you'll wanna play mage/destro/pala or something similar and you'll probably not even be the target a large part of the time.\nDestro wasn't about being able to live by yourself forever, and imo shouldn't be, it should be about control, fast gameplay and solid bursts. The nice thing about these changes is that you can do decent damage outside of your cds or when your shadow school is locked, which means you'll force enemy CDs without using your own sometimes. #12 07/05/2015 Xartím Profile Xartím 100 Undead Warlock Badgers on a Zeppelin 11495 07/05/2015 19:06 Posted by Venger 07/05/2015 14:55 Posted by Xartím How did you feel your survival was without charred remains? did u change the heal (tier 1 talent)?\nThe survival will be fine in 3s with a healer, it won't be a great spec for double dps 2s or something if your playing without charred.

      "text": "General\nIf you ask me, Warlock is one of the most dynamic classes in wow. Your rotation(next spell) can differ from the second. where other classes have a more static rotation to follow, where a few class specific procs occur to change a little up now and then to react to. But as warlock, you are the master of when to cast strong spells and when to generate. This is true for all specs. Therefore tracking trinket, ring and other procs are crucial as a warlock. If you mindlessly cast chaosbolt/Haunt/Soulfire(in meta) when ever you fell like doing so, you quickly see you don't do very much dmg. By that reason it's very effective to build up (Shards/Embers/Demonic fury) For these procs to occur and then fire off the powerfull spells. I see so many warlocks that aren't doing this, which burns my soul inside. Ofcause there can be some occasions where you have to ignore looking for procs and just fire off chaos bolt. (If you're allmost capped on embers, or specific mechanics require you to have 3,4 embers stocked) Aka. Kromog when hands are about to occur or pillars(On mythic). But 90% of the time chaos bolt should be fired with procs.\nI've looked at logs, and can give a few pointers of what your mate can do.\nImprovement\nThings you can do to make your warlock stronger in raids.\n1. Increase dmg on hard hitting spells, by tracking procs. - (So he knows when and when not to cast chaosbolt)\nThis can be done either by weakauras, or tellmewhen or many other addons. It's even integrated in many unitframe addons. But i suggest using weakauras.\nI use this weakaura to track proc when i'm playing destruction on kromog or having fun. (Usualy plays demo)\nhttp://pastebin.com/sec6PNgu\n-Note: I do know Darksoul don't give mastery as destruction, and can't get synergy as destruction, and your warlock presumably use crit weapon proc. Just cba. to change when i'm usualy playing demo xD you can change yourself if need be.\nGorren soul repository is the most important proc besides darksoul. So tell him if this procs, he gotta fire off everything he got. Also, when darksoul is about to come off cooldown, he should save up some embers for the burn.\n2. Choosing optimal talents.\nAs stated in previus posts, Destruction is pretty viable when you have the gear. If the requirements are meet, Which is 4-tier set bonus, Gorren soul repository and using Charred remains as the 100-tier talent. Which he can do, if he changes to Charred remains. Also as stated in previus post, using Grimoire of sacrifice is optimal. Even so when you use Charred remains.\n- Change to Charred remains(100) and Grimoire of Sacrifice(75). Sacrificing different pets for different fights can be a good help. Like a voidwalker will give you the ability to gain an increase in max health, not exceptionally good, but still something in some cases. (When you get fixated on Blast furnace or fixated on Flamebender-mythic.)\n3. Increase activity - Push harder on those buttons man xD\nIn logs you can see his Casts per minut is VERY low. It can be seen here : WarcraftLogs Cast activity\n90% active time = only casted an ability 90% of the time (included global cooldown) Which means 10% of the fight. Which is about 36 seconds in a 6min fight. where he just stands and looks or are moving. I do know destruction warlocks has a hard time to do anything on the move. but at least use useless spells like rain of fire, or perhaps time conflag with the movement, or keep movement to a minimum(To just avoid flares and not by a mile). You could even argue that taking a flare if you're not soon being sliced is acceptable(provided you have half decent healers). Which i would say you have, also as you're going with 5 healers.\n4. Increase uptime on immolate and time conflag(Backdraft).\nLogs says 89,49% avr uptime, on cutuff for 5 people dead. As destrction you don't have many abilities to keep track off. Pandemic comes in and makes this very easy. you can reaply immolate i think it's 4 or 5 seconds before it runs out and still not loose anything on it. The only times immolate should come of the target, is if you come into an odd situation where you have to use chaos bolt with a gorren soul repository proc. but those situations are rare and the time immolate is down is minimal.\n- You can help this by using good unitframes and/or weakauras to track it. On encounters with more than 1 target, aka. Iron maidens and Hans'gar&Franzok. Good boss frames are godly here aswell. Incenerate is the lowest priority spell allways. I would even argue it's better to overcast immolate and Conflag to keep uptime and not capping the cooldown on conflag that it is to mindlessly casting incenerate.\n- when i'm playing destruction, i'm often not looking to optimize and do mad deeps. I'm just in for the fun and relaxtion. I use weakaura to tell me when it's okay or would be ideal to cast immolate. It pops up if i don't have immolate on target or there's only 5 sec or so left on immolate.\nWeakaura string: Immolate\nRegarding Conflagrate. I'm not very sure on this. But i believe it's best to not use both charges, Hold 1 charge but never cap it. Reason is, you can have a conflag on demand for movement, or when a important proc occurs. you can fire off chaos bolts quickly to be able to squeze in more chaos bolts during good proc. if i'm not mistaken, it's best to use backdraft on chaos bolt if you have good procs and use it on incenerate to generate embers faster for when procs aren't there. It looks to me that you never hold that one charge, casts back to back conflags in the start which can be viable in some situations if you ask me. But then just keeps it at 0 charges and casts as soon as 1 charge gets off cooldown. Tho if holding 1 charge allways, it's very important not to cap on 2 charges aswell. use conflag just before 2nd charge is ready.\n5. Choosing optimal spec\nFor your warlock mate to perform better(Optimal). As stated in previus posts, as you're not looking for ranks or anything he can play what ever he wants. But if you want him to perform better in general. Have him check out demonology. A vast majority of fights in Blackrock foundry will demonology perform alot better. Demonology is very mobile and alot more flexible and dynamic to some of the more unpredictable and heavy movement requiring fights. Tho harder and more complicated for some people. But you could even argue that it's a waste of time, since the nerfbat will come swining at demonology for 6.2. But it would help your raid if he went demology and got decent at it. Definitely helps raids if people was interested in playing their best in the best performing spec they could. Even tho you don't seek ranks, it still increases chances of success and fast progress.\nLast comment\nWoops i think i went a little overboard on this one. We have a warlock too in our guild which has trouble with core warlock mechanics, like yours have. So i've allready made something similar to this. I'm sorry about spelling/grammar mistakes and such.\nI hope this can help your warlock to perform better in your raids. Most of the time, it's the lack of know how, On how to improve.\nTools to improve\nWarcraftLogs\n- Introduce him to warcraftlogs and teach him to compare logs from higher ranks so he can spot his own mistakes by himself.\nMMO-Champion forums\n- Also Introduce him to MMO-Champion so he can stalk the forums himself and look for things to learn about.\nSummonstone\n- Introduce him to this website. summonstone , it's guides which are written by very good players of the specific class. I usualy use this for my alts, when i cant be bothered to go in-depth. I take a look at this, it has tips and tricks for each boss on mythic for your specific class and role. Also talents and such for each boss. They also go in-depth with rotation and core mechanics and what not. Also recommend addons and weakauras to have. Very good site in my opinion.\nSimulationcraft\n- Introduce him to simulationcraft: Simulationcraft . It's a free simulator which imports your char from armory and calculates what you should do in dmg theoretically. Options such as (Heavy movement fight, Helter skelter, patchwerk) Can be set. Even if your wish to calculate dps not having a specific buff in your raid to further accurately predict what he should do. (can be set to Ouch fire bad(LFR) average(Normal), good(Heroic) and elite(Mythic) player)\nI Hope this helps. Good luck with progress. :-D",
